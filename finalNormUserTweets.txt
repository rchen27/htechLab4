I have a day off on the weekend and i have money yet im just at home like clearly my level of lame is at an all time high
i guess i gotta learn how to be happy by myself
but i guess everyone is not meant to be happy
I dont need your pity i just want to know how you were able to achieve happiness like thats all i want
That twist got my hyped up like straight up goals
Real shit  https://t.co/58g9R5zWpC
This empire got my hyped tho
Honestly I just have one objective right now
RT @ltsHoroscopes: Sad but true 😂😂😂😂😂😂 http://t.co/jsKhb8fzlL
So for all those plotting revenge I say wait karma will have your back just give it some time
Karma is a bitch like you can run from karma but you can't hide it will find you eventually
as long as you work to make yourself better then nothing is a waste of time just remember that when you are gonna give up
like that fuels tf out of me like it keeps me going when nothing else will like my shot at redemption like man its gonna feel great.
them feel regret like damn i should have been there for him like honestly i want to see that look of we messed up
trust me i learned that the hard way like just crying waiting for someone to help me up and then it snapped and i realized i have to
I know its hard to keep trying but if you dont no one will come save you like all you have is you and a belief in yourself
If you dont know what you wanna be thats okay just keep grinding till you do
don't let anyone hold you back from not doing something like remember there is always a million different reasons not to do something.
One thing that you have to remeber is not to blame anyone else for something you didnt do like now its your fault but that being said
Its okay to cry and break down but after you do all that you gotta get up and keep fighting like just keep trying.
Whats the worst thing that will happen if you fail?
Honestly tho we do need that one person that's going to hold us accountable but the thing is that one person can be yourself
I just want to be someone that my kid self would look up too like is that to much for me to ask for?
i honestly was always scared to not be liked by someone or to fail when everyone would see me but now? i could care less
your not too old or your not too behind like dont worry about what your family, friends or even media will think like just do what you want
You gotta stop and think maybe i need to change what im doing like dont be scared to change your goals
RT @ThoughtsofCole: Gotta appreciate the folk that appreciate you ....
if you do find happiness with youself then congrats thats should be your biggest goal like nothing will phase you
you might think it is but trust me it wont just make yourself happy
there is no point to be liked by everyone and for everyone to know your name like at the end of the day thats not gonna make you happy

Tbh, I wish there was someone who deserves the type of shit i offer ina relationship buhhh y'all females be playing to fucking much 😂😂😂👍💯
When your ex's ex, your ex's crush, and your ex's friends constantly lurking on your shit 😂😂😂
Someone asked me "How'd you get over your ex?" I smiled and said "On the cool, my ass isn't even over her yet."
When someone tells you they'll be there for you no matter what... But yet they never seem to be there... Taha... Shit hurts and sucks... 💯👍
You know watching someone you love world fall apart hurts.. Especially when you wanted to give that someone the complete opposite... 😞💯💔
RT @BrandonCyrus: Nothing's more exhausting than fighting with the one you love and having them being so ignorant and uncaring 😔💔
I hate the fact that I used to be everything to you... And now ? I get treated like I never existed... And that shit hurts a shit ton
Missing you .... Taha
RT @FemaIeStruggle: Never apologize for saying what you feel, its like saying sorry for being real
I don't wanna chase you, I wanna see if you'd at least come look for me... 💯👍
Stay hooked on my ex or move on ? Nah rather just keep these feelings and see what happens... Ima let time do its thing.. 💯😎🔥
RT @SteveStfler: I have no problem texting you first as long as you make me feel like you actually wanna talk. Cut that dry shit out.
Missing someone right now.... Fucked up part is, I have a feeling she ain't missing me... 😞
Tbh, theres now a gap in my heart, and the only one who can fill that gap is you...
As long as you happy.... That's all that matter 💯
To you im just a thing to the past. I tried, you didn't realize what I did to make us last.... 💯
So apparently my ex thinks Im going after her friends. Okay okay, I still have the deepest feelings for you and your gunna assume this ?!
lol  https://t.co/C7dXEVBZq2
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: thinking back to when you first met someone &amp; how you were completely unaware of just how much they would mean to you. it…

RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Everything will fall into place, you just gotta be patient..

RT @KalinWhite: She takin my time but it's worth it
No matter how hard you try.. No matter how much you try and hurt me.. I'll still fucking love you.. You gave me to much just to give in !! 💯
RT @BrandonCyrus: how can someone promise a future with you and take it all away from you with no remorse whatsoever
RT @BrandonCyrus: don't promise forever if you don't mean it
RT @Drakee_YMCMB: Two things define you. Your patience when you have nothing, and your attitude when you have everything.
Been awhile since she hasnt responded , hope everything is okay 😟💯
I be missing her like crazy....
The easiest thing to do is walk away. But the hardest part is leaving everything you had behind you.... 😭💔😐
I'm sad. I feel like shit. Constantly throwing up. Well lets see how this day goes ...
Strangers.
Friends.
Best Friends.
Couple.
Friends.
Strangers.

Saddest shit ever 💔😭
I lost someone who I valued very much... 😭💔
I love you... 
I miss you...
I care for you...
I always will... 
#scl
She been hurting me but its all good i mean it happens and I got ways to put up with it... 💊👅
I wonder why she's being like this ? I didn't do anything wrong.... Shit hurts that were at this level 😞💔
Man I'm tired asf' this day needs tonend already.....
I went from somebody to nobody in her eyes real quick... 💔😐

@ChefsWriter -the Louvre is one of my dreams. I'd like to see Germany, too. Maybe Wales, where my father's side is from.
@ChefsWriter That's incredible. I've been through a lot of the Eastern states but nowhere near 30. Paris would be magnificent. Visiting -
@MJKimble1 Yes! And it's extra fitting because both of my roommates (and myself soon enough) are firefighters. :D
@ChefsWriter Good lord. I'd give anything to go to Europe.
@ChefsWriter I feel so boring. XD My goodness. I've never stepped foot off US soil.
@WitchPond That's precious!
@ChefsWriter I don't doubt it one bit. :) How lovely. Have you ever been out of the country?
@MJKimble1 He's got a little fireman's helmet, too. :D

@ChefsWriter I've always wanted to go to Japan. I'm envious.
@ChefsWriter How long will he be in Japan?
@ChefsWriter That's so strange, I've got a brother that my family took in and "adopted" too. He was in Afghan. with my biological brother.
@ChefsWriter My little brother was in for a while but was discharged for medical reasons, unfortunately.
@ChefsWriter Wow, that's commendable. You weren't kidding. I know both of my granfathers served as well, but I'm not sure in which branches.
@ChefsWriter So strictly Air Force, or mixed? :) For me it's Guard and Marines. Family dinners are always interesting, let me tell you.
@ChefsWriter That's so cool, I stayed in Florida for a while before my brother's deployment. He was stationed in Mississippi, though.
@FateZankoku They're the best. I don't understand why people get so scared around them.
@ChefsWriter I'm usually there once or twice a year for symposiums and the like. Military family.
@ChefsWriter I've had to do that many times in my life. XD Not fun at all. I'm glad it was a good experience for you. :)
@WitchPond Aw! Is this your photo? :D
@WitchPond They did! But then they were scared away from it by a jerk kid. I'm sure it'll be found again :)
Me and that little dudes paths were meant to cross tonight.
Racoon hands are the cutest.
@ChefsWriter Goodness, that's luck. Plane rides during any sort of bad weather are so awful. Did you enjoy your stay?
@ChefsWriter XD That's a pretty good reason.
@ChefsWriter What brought you to Des Moines? I love that city very much.
@ChefsWriter I don't follow football much. My roommates do, that's the only reason I know anything. More of a basketball person.
I gave it a potato.
@ChefsWriter Did you? :) I spent a bit of time there on vacation once. I've got great memories of it. Iowa girl here. Hawkeye nation.
IT WAS SITTING ON MY BOOT.
THERE'S A RACOON NEAR ME.
I'm laughing.
Tfw you're shopping with your brother and he gets fire call so you're stranded at the market because he took your car. Omg. This night.
@ChefsWriter Tomorrow will be better. Sounds like a night at my place. Who's playing?
@ChefsWriter *Hugs warmly* Thank you, sweetheart. Rough day.
@rainyday321 That's the highest, most wonderful comment. x) Thank you, doll. It's easier than you think!

@ChefsWriter He's been really puffed up and dopey from the shots he was given, but otherwise he's doing really well. Thank god.
@Whiskeyandspite That's exactly what happened. 💜
Kind of funny (but not really) that soon after talking about wolf spiders with @ChefsWriter my puppy picked a fight with one and lost.
@Whiskeyandspite We took him to the emergency clinic for some shots. Doing much better. Poor dear keeps bumping into things. XD

Women really be trying to see if they can feel your dick when they big you. They're perverts.  Men only hug with pure intentions.
See, y'all be slandering chubby dudes. That's why I'll be staying out of all y'all DMs
Why to people act like sex that happens from pure lust is inferior to sex rooted in love?
I have no idea how you get married then tell your someone that you settled, especially tell the person you feel turned you down.
Fun times she was throwing the pussy and i was not trying to catch it. Then she got married  and told me it should've been "us".
One woman on facbook always makes me smile, cause I showed up tohangout with her on what I had no idea was a date.

brOKen1217
Me: *starts coughing*
*aggressive coughing fit*
Me: h-help *coughs* 
*almost blacks out*
Coworker: are you sick?
Me: oh for fucks sake
And be caught up on her for M O N T H S.
Never in my life did I think I would like a girl. Fuck.
12. I often wonder who, if anyone besides my dad would actually care if I died right now.
11. Instead of a mother I have an empty vessel that used to hold her soul, but now holds my worst nightmares.
10. I don't have a mom. She... Died when I was 2.
9. I have one friend, 4 human family members and 2 dogs
8. I write everything from music to books, and that's what I spend 80% of my time doing.
7. I'm demisexual, which means I don't feel attraction to people before I build an emotional bond with them. 
It's not a preference.
6. I have no self-confidence. My self-esteem is nonexistent, and that goes for physical appearance too amongst other aspects.
5. Music is the heard and soul of my life. It is truly the only reason I am still breathing. I swear up and down I would be dead without it.
4. Now-a-days I suffer from generalized anxiety, social anxiety, depression, manageable OCD and PTSD. I do have suicidal thoughts.
3. I've attempted suicide 2 times and almost commit  by acc. I tried to od, jumped in front of a car and the accident was I cut too deep.
2. My depression started when I was about 11-12. Anxiety started at 7-8.
1. I won't say my name, but I really wanna go by Reaper. I used to go by Ghost a really long time ago, but I'm currently really into Reaper.
So, hi. Nobody follows this account, thank God, but here are some facts about me.
Sometimes I talk and act as if people actually care about me, but then I remember that nobody cares
I always live to regret talking about my feelings
Not a single fucking time do I ever not regret telling someone how I'm feeling
Isn't it great when you're so stressed you get a headache and feel nauseous at 2 am
Fuck. Biology. This is the most boring subject of all time
Because I'm all alone, just like I like things...
There's something so comforting about being up so late. 
Its like the whole world is sleeping, and I don't have to worry about anything.
Would you even care if I took my own life?
She couldn't keep the red to her fingernails.
You have no fucking idea what it feels like to wholeheartedly believe no one would care about me if I killed myself
Dads the only one who would care. 
A would move on. 
R hates me anyways, she'd probably be happy to heard I'm gone for good.
I wish I had cuts up and down my arms too and not just on my thighs
He'd have dogs to keep him occupied, and maybe I'd finally feel truly free.
Dad would be able to move to Florida now instead of having to wait until I'm 18
If dad ever told him, he'd say I got sick or something. Pop-Pop would be broken, but he'd forget soon enough.
Dad would be sad and lie to Pop-Pop about it for as long as he could.
A would be upset, but she'd get over it.
Lets be serious. Who would really care if I took my own life?
Nobody sees my sadness and I don't know if thats a good or a bad thing anymore
Its not a cry for attention if she just wants to feel anything other than the pain.
I really, really want to cut myself
My depression keeps coming back. It was gone for months and now it's back and I don't know why
God I'm such a fuck up
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind 🎶
Fuck. 
I finally understand that song.
Say it for me, say it to me, and I'll leave this life behind me. 
Say it if it's worth savin' me.
I'm terrified of these 4 walls 🎶
Just like at home 😅
I'd have a panic attack in first or second period and then fuck something up
Alright lets be serious I wouldn't even last a day in high school
Come at me
She's literally 6 inches shorter than me. Fucking fight me bitch
Thats so rich coming from the bitch who told me this shift doesnt need a 3rd worker :) :) :) fuck you
I never had a mom to teach me how to iron dress clothes or bake. My grandmother was the closest to that I ever had, and she's gone
Having her around makes me wish I had a mom

And on my next album, we’ll be doing covers of embarrassing #Nickelback songs like “Figured You Out”.
My next album is to be titled “An Evening with Gonnhorreus Syphilititus (and Friends)”. Featuring collaborations with #Adele and #Lights!
A lot of people say #Adele is fat. I’m usually turned off by “fat” girls, but Adele is physically HOT (by my standards). I’d fuck her!
And in a comment I am going to regret saying - I am a fan of Victoria Duffield’s music video for “More Than Friends.”
Even if you’re a teenager, you shouldn’t be a fan of #VictoriaDuffield’s “More Than Friends”. But I am! So I’m fucked, because I'm an adult.
@whirlpoolusa Plan. Frame. Convict. Unjustifiably imprison. Sleep easier. #EverydayCare #EveryActOfFascismCounts #FreeRevPinkney
My previous tweet - spoken like a true pervert (which I am).
I regularly UNLEASH myself on college age girls if they happen to walk in my direction, or make the mistake of making eye contact with me.
After watching #Lights’ “Same Sea” music video, all I want to do is use my teeth to tear off those red shorts.
@whirlpoolusa I’m as thankful as you are that Rev. Pinkney was unjustly imprisoned. #EverydayCare #EveryActOfFascismCounts #FreeRevPinkney
@whirlpoolusa I’m doing what those guys WERE doing - getting drunk! #DrunkComa #EverydayCare #EveryActOfFascismCounts #FreeRevPinkney
Oh man, I was beginning to worry that I was the only one that liked my tweets. https://t.co/fNZReCrhBR
@whirlpoolusa Church to Court. Court to Prison. Silencing your political enemies, is SO #WorthIt 
#FreeRevPinkney #EveryActOfFascismCounts
“I signed up for the military - I just assumed I’d never have to kill, and never pay any sort of personal price.” - Moronic Career Soldier.
“Drone pilots are proud to serve their country - until they get PTSD. Then they’re useless, and become anti-drone.” - Mr. Controversy.
@whirlpoolusa You must be one hell of a pig if you can eat all that food in eight minutes. #FreeRevPinkney #EveryActOfFascismCounts
“Being a Syrian refugee in Canada isn’t as bad as being an aboriginal woman in Canada.” - Mr. Controversy. #CdnPoli
Mr. Controversy's Canadian Immigration Slogan: “Welcome to Canada - now you get to live like you’re on an aboriginal reserve.” #CdnPoli
“#Trudeau wants Canada to train anti-ISIS fighters. So they’ll be trained, and then they’ll become refugees.” - Mr. Controversy. #CdnPoli
“I know more about killing than those military clowns that pilot drones - and I haven’t even killed anyone.” - Mr. Controversy.
“The perversity of #GonnhorreusSyphilititus is contagious.” - NASA’s Top Science Expert, after examining G. Syz’s senior citizen friend.
My senior citizen friend hadn’t lusted for women in decades - until he started hanging out with me! I bring out everyone’s inner pervert!
So #TheSoup and #TotalDivas are the only shows I watch on E! I hope that you (my biggest fan) haven’t totally lost trust in me.
I must now apologize for misleading YOU in an earlier tweet, because I also watch #TotalDivas on E! (even though it’s junk TV at its worst).
That award sounds hilariously fake. #RIPSoup https://t.co/3G3Aqz38Z0
One thing I will say about #TheSoup - I learned a lot about comedy from watching that TV show.  And #JoelMcHale was a brilliant host.
E! is canceling #TheSoup - the only show worth watching on their shitty TV channel. Fuck E!
I mean, it’s not possible for a non-senior citizen to be a fan of #StuartMcLean’s old man radio show #VinylCafe.
#StuartMcLean is dying. So I guess Canadian senior citizens will have to turn to #RexMurphy for their weekly dose of old man comedy.
#StuartMcLean has melanoma? I call dibs on front row seats at his funeral.
https://t.co/YbB4wKFdmi
@whirlpoolusa If you mean GETTING WASTED, you're reading me like a book! #Drunksgiving #FreeRevPinkney #EveryActOfFascismCounts
It’s #JamieLeeCurtis from a decade ago. And LOOK AT THOSE AMAZING TITS! Jamie... call me! #ChristmasWithTheKranks https://t.co/6wba6ryJ8e
Hello, #Adele. I love #Hello! What can I say? #GonnhorreusSyphilititus does not hide (nor deny) the feminine aspects of his personality.
@whirlpoolusa Indeed. They come from news reports on FOX News. #FreeRevPinkney #EveryActOfFascismCounts
@whirlpoolusa @tide @GMA There’s nothing worse than watching an episode of Good Morning America. #FreeRevPinkney #EveryActOfFascismCounts
The robot I’ve been harassing (that operates the @whirlpoolusa account) is CLEARLY shitting itself. #FreeRevPinkney #EveryActOfFascismCounts
“A person who thinks they’re wise, but is not. [I’ve got a] huge problem with [people like] that.” - Mr. Controversy.
“The Nazis initially envisioned the #Volkswagen as a wagon full of Jewish corpses.” - Mr. Controversy.
“Rob Ford’s cancer will have to do the talk show circuit.” - Mr. Controversy.
G. Syz: “You hear how #RobFord’s cancer is going?”
Mr. Controversy: “No. I hope it’s going well.”
(Mr. Controversy hopes Rob Ford is dying).
“Gonnhorreus, I’m almost certain you’re not a literary guy (even though I liked your novel).” - Mr. Controversy.
“Why do people who don’t know the meaning of the word ‘radicalization’ repeatedly use it?” - Mr. Controversy, on #ISIS "experts".
Your move, @whirlpoolusa. Trying to drown out my message with your army of sock puppets won’t work. #FreeRevPinkney #EveryActOfFascismCounts
@whirlpoolusa All my Christmas memories tend to be in a drunken haze, so it’s not worth it. #FreeRevPinkney #EveryActOfFascismCounts
@whirlpoolusa You’re referring to the Manson Family, aren’t you? #FreeRevPinkney #EveryActOfFascismCounts
@whirlpoolusa How very presumptuous, since I’m a bachelor. I also hate Christmas, and children. #FreeRevPinkney #EveryActOfFascismCounts
@whirlpoolusa Yes, because every parent LOVES it when their kids can’t afford to move out. #FreeRevPinkney #EveryActOfFascismCounts
@whirlpoolusa What if your family are cannibals? #FreeRevPinkney #EveryActOfFascismCounts
@whirlpoolusa If housecleaning is the best you can do in life, then you have nothing to celebrate. #FreeRevPinkney #EveryActOfFascismCounts
Saw my doctor today. She said I’m still going through puberty.
This just in - #CharlieSheen revealed to have infected himself with HIV, in desperate bid to rejuvenate his career.

@MurrClurrBurr loyalty.
All my friends in kirksville should hang out with me within the next two weeks because its starting to hit me that I'll be gone soon.

T_Mac202
Really?
Helps my fantasy defense tho lol
Matt Ryan that was awful.  Awful
Wow clipping on the goaline... 15 yard penalty
Finally a pass down the field
This Alex Smith two minutes offense is taking forever, and they got about 10 yards
@ChiSqueezer thank you dear lol
Take a knee, go to the locker room
Get off the field
Good coverage
@skinzmama O_o. Lmao
@Leese007 ;)
They giving Cousins the business at the bottom of that pile lol
You taketh, we taketh back.  Touchdown
Go for it
Ok no points before half
@Leese007 haha. Yes indeed.  I feel yours too ;)
That route is so tough to cover
Well look at that, a touchdown!
@Leese007 yea buddy
Go vertical it's a TD
Did he slip? He went lateral
@LovelyLadyNeka I see
@bitesizecutey lol
DO NOT HOLD PLEASE
Get down Garçon lol
Sammy Watkins touchdown
@MoCurlie without comment or questions.  Indeed
@LovelyLadyNeka on the way :).  You are trying to butter me up lol
Sammy Watkins is having a huge day. Catching shit in double coverage
Giants play 48 different running backs
@LovelyLadyNeka yea that was a given
@LovelyLadyNeka deal
Yea he did “@JD_marsh22: Amari Coop just mossed him!!”
@LovelyLadyNeka what are the perks?
Chris Thompson is questionable.  Means Morris will be the 3rd down back.  O_o
@MoCurlie there are perks
@TheYelloNegro inhope they keep it up
@Monee_121 np
@Monee_121 14-3
Good ole Brandon Merriweather
Redskins offensive gameplan: We have to score quickly before the holding penalties come.
Toasted
Well Look at that, a long touchdown
@jmoneygrip indeed
Well look at that, a sack
Well look at that, points
2 &amp; 30?  Get the kicker ready
I hope Reed will have more catches today than penalties
Can't go 4 plays in a row without holding
Nice play call

She's the only reason I still have FaceBook and it should be no shock to me that she'd be the only one to like Hamilton.
Our mate attractions may be opposites, but she's literally the only person I've met in person that likes the same stuff as me.
It's same were two ships on different seas, because the first person I was ever me with has the exact same tastes as me.
Sometimes spamporn bots follow me. I wonder if they feel disappointment when they learn their "XXX tits" hold no sway?

@dukelongboard truly a blessing
My friends, I have important news: I just ate a sopapilla
@itsrealH @DINOTHING he couldn't hang out because his mom needed her station wagon to go to target and he doesn't have a ride now
@DINOTHING it's really weird that a man who's almost 40, is in 10 bands and bartends for a living is unreliable
12% of the people who read this grew up playing outside and not online. Press like if you're part of the 1% who joined a racist country club
@neonwario @LuckyStubbs the large wife is truly a classic trope
@LuckyStubbs @neonwario actually, that's what I call my wife
@Bruisey i still cry about that
@neonwario its on the Mount Rushmore of crimes
A lot of people say that they long for the innocence of childhood, but the part I really miss is having someone else pay for everything
@McNorfin we are all dead
One of the good things about the block function is it protects me from you fucking idiots who retweet Lil B
Ignore me because I have depression? Nice sad hominem attack
I tweet about the Grateful Dead a lot, but it's equally important to remember that "Teenage Riot" by Sonic Youth is a timeless masterpiece
@machiavellino changing your contact name for this
Please ignore the 16 minute interlude on my latest mixtape where I beg for sex and then cry. It's just a skit taken out of context
@aloonstar it honestly is
@aloonstar you're probably being ironic but that song is genuinely really special to me for reasons
You: did you see the game?
Todd Sports: Life is a game bitch, and it's game over
@JordanFreiman that's a fucking great show. I'm really into the 71 and 76 shows from the 30 trips set
Looks like Todd Sports is back on the menu bitch
@chrisfilson he's back baby
@chrisfilson I'm Todd Sports
@cooperlund they played that a lot. Just had a long break. It's so good too tho
@JordanFreiman the 73 versions in particular speak to me. Daves picks 5 from UCLA I believe features and insane version
The most underrated and underplayed dead song was "mission in the rain"
@GregWood1234 it was one of only 2 shows in 1975. All the blues for Allah tunes. One of the best shows ever imo
@gratefulmaggzzz are you going to accidentally send me any links today
@GregWood1234 beautiful, but the one from the vault version in 75 is the standard
There's few things better than a 1974 "eyes of the world"

I'm honestly about to cry my dad gave up his bed so I could sleep in it bc the smell in my room keeps getting worse

@gdimerthur no it's not. we've never had rodent issues. but I've tried that and nothing is working. and I'm having one of those nights -
@gdimerthur it's just so weird bc I haven't spilled anything in that spot? at least not within the past few months. so idk what it is.
I literally cannot get rid of this fucking smell
this is why I fucking hate carpet
so the terrible smell in my room is coming from my floor, in a spot I don't remember spilling anything on??
I've been so good about taking trash out of my room but I tend to not notice one think and it's always something that ends up super gross ha
I think I figured out what's making my room stink.. I have a Starbucks cup sitting on my windowsill that's been there for.. who knows.. lol
I just want 2 days off in a row so I can rest. And I can't do like the sl manager and just roll into work whenever I feel like it.
like I almost want to call in on Friday bc my soft lines manager scheduled me for that day even tho I asked for that day off.
work weekends bc there's no one else to count tills/safe on the weekends.
everyone else would just tell me to get over it and deal with it. but I feel like I only ever see Tonya on the weekends and rn I HAVE to
she's one of the few people that knows about my mental illnesses, and actually gives a shit bc her daughter dealt with it too.
the only person that would understand if I called out for a mental health day, would be Tonya, my store manager.
before i was sad for no reason, now it's bc of work. work is too much for me to mentally handle.

I don't feel comfortable moving his truck. I don't feel comfortable behind the wheel of a truck bc I'm small and they feel way too big.
