CS 5555 Lab 4 Machine Learning and Twitter
-----------------------

### Team

Roger Chen and Shimiao Huang

### Objective

Our goal for this project is to predict and identify depression in Twitter users. We now want to use tweets to try and create a classifier to predict mental health problems based on the language people use in social media.


### Project

This repo contains the files used to scrape the data and run the classifier. The files 'tweetSearch.py' and 'userSearch.py' use the Twitter Search API to search for users to used in our dataset. The file 'healthClassifier.py' uses sklearn to process the text and train our model.
