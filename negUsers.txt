My friends, I have important news: I just ate a sopapilla
@itsrealH @DINOTHING he couldn't hang out because his mom needed her station wagon to go to target and he doesn't have a ride now
@DINOTHING it's really weird that a man who's almost 40, is in 10 bands and bartends for a living is unreliable
12% of the people who read this grew up playing outside and not online. Press like if you're part of the 1% who joined a racist country club
@neonwario @LuckyStubbs the large wife is truly a classic trope

@Bruisey i still cry about that

@cooperlund they played that a lot. Just had a long break. It's so good too tho
@JordanFreiman the 73 versions in particular speak to me. Daves picks 5 from UCLA I believe features and insane version
The most underrated and underplayed dead song was "mission in the rain"
@GregWood1234 it was one of only 2 shows in 1975. All the blues for Allah tunes. One of the best shows ever imo
@gratefulmaggzzz are you going to accidentally send me any links today
@GregWood1234 beautiful, but the one from the vault version in 75 is the standard

I've been so good about taking trash out of my room but I tend to not notice one think and it's always something that ends up super gross ha
I think I figured out what's making my room stink.. I have a Starbucks cup sitting on my windowsill that's been there for.. who knows.. lol
I just want 2 days off in a row so I can rest. And I can't do like the sl manager and just roll into work whenever I feel like it.
like I almost want to call in on Friday bc my soft lines manager scheduled me for that day even tho I asked for that day off.
work weekends bc there's no one else to count tills/safe on the weekends.
everyone else would just tell me to get over it and deal with it. but I feel like I only ever see Tonya on the weekends and rn I HAVE to
she's one of the few people that knows about my mental illnesses, and actually gives a shit bc her daughter dealt with it too.
the only person that would understand if I called out for a mental health day, would be Tonya, my store manager.
before i was sad for no reason, now it's bc of work. work is too much for me to mentally handle.
today is just another low spoons day and it's hard

also it would be great if my managers could get to work on time instead of constantly making me late
it's cold  I'm tired. I'm dead inside. And everything fucking hurts.
too much back and hip pain rn I don't have time for this I need sleep
also I'm fucking tired and I just want to sleep but I can't stop thinking about everything and it's making it hard to fall asleep
I just wasn't sure if he remembered bc he was in the middle of a kitchen project so I was just reminding him
I don't feel comfortable moving his truck. I don't feel comfortable behind the wheel of a truck bc I'm small and they feel way too big.
when u nicely ask ur dad if he moved his truck from behind ur car bc u don't want to have to move it at 5am and he gives u fuckin attitude

@jackcronin22 ok cool thanks
@jackcronin22 I mean I can't when u tweet ignorance saying that the 4 playoff teams don't matter cause if ND was in it u would care about it
@jackcronin22 ok u could have saved me the time and said that and only that nothing else
@jackcronin22 ok that's your opinion I never have claimed u were wrong so y r u starting shit... your opinion is your opinion
@jackcronin22 doesn't mean I said they were the best I just thought they were better than Notre Dame I think that Oklahoma wins it all
@jackcronin22 lmao I'm the complete opposite I think MSU will lose first round of the playoff don't put words in my mouth u sound ignorant
@jackcronin22 Im not making an ass of myself u r just mad so u have nothing else to say but that u r gonna get me somehow smh
@jackcronin22 Im not bragging Im just laughing at the ignorance of u saying ND will be in the playoff before and at least MSU wins big games
@jackcronin22 never said MSU was winning it so......but at least they will get to the playoff along with Oklahoma Clemson and Bama
RT @Matthew__Becker: But Notre Dame should be top 4😂
@jackcronin22 lmao u r mad call me what u want but im not crying about my team losing
@jackcronin22 ok I watched the game u r still salty and no playoff for them end of story I'm not mad u r, and u r a bandwagon so..
@jackcronin22 I watched the game and when u give up a big catch with 28 seconds left then it's the defenses fault
@jackcronin22 Notre Dames defense lost them that game doesn't matter about the backups lol get the facts straight
@jackcronin22 I mean I'm pretty sure people cared still about Winston, Mariota, Cooper and others but u r just salty that ND lost again
@jackcronin22 anyone in the playoff matters.....but I could be wrong

@jackcronin22 @Matthew__Becker @crayquinn plus it's not like Notre Dame has to win their way in to a conference championship so..
@jackcronin22 @Matthew__Becker @crayquinn it's the only good team they played and there are teams who play harder games that deserve it
@jackcronin22 @Matthew__Becker @crayquinn at the time Clemson was the underdog and beat an over rated ND, and ND is still over rated
@jackcronin22 @Matthew__Becker @crayquinn  Notre Dame lost to Clemson when at the time Clemson was #12 in the AP and Notre Dame was #6
